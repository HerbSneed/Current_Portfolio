# 02 Portfolio
My portfolio webpage for present & future content created.  

## Page Contents
The page contains a Header, Banner, Main Content and a footer.

### Header
The header contains three clickable links; About Me, Work, Contact Me & Resume.

### Banner
The banner contains an image of myself overlayed over a background.

### About Me
When the user clicks on About Me, the browser automatically scrolls to the About Me section where there's a paragraph about my history.

### Work
When the user clicks on Work, the browser automatically scrolls to the Work section where there are five clickable links (links that are attached to images) that jump to a landing page for furture projects.  Upon hovering over each image there's a glow around the border to let the user know which project is being selected.

### Landing Page
Each landing page has a home button that will allow the user to return to the main page.

### Contact Me
When the user click on Contact Me, the browser automatically scrolls to the footer (Contact Me Section) where there are clickable links to contact me via telephone (with FaceTime, Duo, or which ever defaul application is set up on the users device), email (with users default email applicaation), GitHub (links to my GitHub account) and Twitter (links to my twitter page).
